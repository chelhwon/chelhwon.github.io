        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Traditional structure from motion is hard in indoor environments with only a few detectable point features. 
            These environments, however, have other useful characteristics: they often contain severable visible lines, 
            and their layout typically conforms to a Manhattan world geometry. We introduce a new algorithm to cluster visible 
            lines in a Manhattan world, seen from two different viewpoints, into coplanar bundles. This algorithm is 
            based on the notion of “characteristic line”, which is an invariant of a set of parallel coplanar lines. 
            Finding coplanar sets of lines becomes a problem of clustering characteristic lines, which can be accomplished 
            using a modified mean shift procedure. The algorithm is computationally light and produces good results 
            in real world situations.</p>
